- Each player has a bag that starts with 2 of each item. 
- Any time you get items from neutral drops it pulls from the bag. After Every carousel round you get 1 more of each item added to the bag
- If there are 2 item components you want form carousel and you're unsure which one to go for, 
you should go for the one you have gotten more of from drops for better odds.

Keyboard Controls Reference

    D-Key: Refreshes the Champion Store! This costs you 2-gold when you do it.

    F-Key: Purchases XP towards leveling up your team. The higher level you have, the more Champions you can have on the board.

    W-Key: If you press W while hovering over a Champion, it will deploy it to the battlefield from the bench and vice versa. 
           This is more useful for benching Champions, because you are going to want to specifically place your Champions in a position to maximize their potential.

    E-Key: If you press this while hovering over one of your Champions, it will sell them to the store. Just be careful not to accidentally sell one you want to keep!

    1-Key and 3-Key: These will cycle you through your opponent's boards! The 1-Key will go to the next board, and the 3-Key will go to the previous board. 
           This is useful for scouting what the other players are using!

    CTRL + 1-4: If you hold the control key and press 1, 2, 3, or 4 on your keyboard, your Little Legend will do an emote! Each Little Legend has their own emotes, 
           so they won't be consistent across the board.

    2-Key or Spacebar: Pressing the spacebar will bring your camera back to your Little Legend. 
           This is useful if you want to get back to what's going on after you were scouting your opponent's boards.
